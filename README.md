As we know, machine learning has endless applications and we can use it to develop optimal solutions to diverse problems.

In the field of petrophysics has a considerable utility and everyday is in constant growth, applied to the cluster analysis to determine sedimentary facies, generation of synthetic well curves, and so on.

The present analysis approachs the posibility of repairing low cuality curves (logs) available of a well, either for presence of washouts or other factors that may disturb the response of before mentioned curves.

We will evaluate two wells ("Well_1", "Well_3").
